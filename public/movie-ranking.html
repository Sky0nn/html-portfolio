<h1>Skyler's Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>The Only Correct Choices</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Corpse Bride</h3>
<p>Tim Burton. Love the story and the songs, what else needs to be said?</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
<p>My favorite Spider-Man trilogy (even with a 4th one in development). The crossovers
    and everything are amazing.

<h3>Deadpool 3</h3>
<p>Marvel has had some bangers lately.</p>
